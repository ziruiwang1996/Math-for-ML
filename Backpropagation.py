# # Backpropagation
# ## Instructions
#
# In this assignment, you will train a neural network to draw a curve.
# The curve takes one input variable, the amount travelled along the curve from 0 to 1, and returns 2 outputs, the 2D coordinates of the position of points on the curve.
#
# To help capture the complexity of the curve, we shall use two hidden layers in our network with 6 and 7 neurons respectively.
#
# ![Neural network with 2 hidden layers. There is 1 nodes in the zeroth layer, 6 in the first, 7 in the second, and 2 in the third.](readonly/bigNet.png "The structure of the network we will consider in this assignment.")
#
# You will be asked to complete functions that calculate the Jacobian of the cost function, with respect to the weights and biases of the network. Your code will form part of a stochastic steepest descent algorithm that will train your network.
#
# ### Matrices in Python
# Recall from assignments in the previous course in this specialisation that matrices can be multiplied together in two ways.
#
# Element wise: when two matrices have the same dimensions, matrix elements in the same position in each matrix are multiplied together
# In python this uses the '$*$' operator.
# ```python
# A = B * C
# ```
#
# Matrix multiplication: when the number of columns in the first matrix is the same as the number of rows in the second.
# In python this uses the '$@$' operator
# ```python
# A = B @ C
# ```
#
# This assignment will not test which ones to use where, but it will use both in the starter code presented to you.
# There is no need to change these or worry about their specifics.
#
# ### How to submit
# To complete the assignment, edit the code in the cells below where you are told to do so.
# Once you are finished and happy with it, press the **Submit Assignment** button at the top of this worksheet.
# Test your code using the cells at the bottom of the notebook before you submit.
#
# Please don't change any of the function names, as these will be checked by the grading script.

# ## Feed forward
#
# In the following cell, we will define functions to set up our neural network.
# Namely an activation function, $\sigma(z)$, it's derivative, $\sigma'(z)$, a function to initialise weights and biases, and a function that calculates each activation of the network using feed-forward.
#
# Recall the feed-forward equations,
# $$ \mathbf{a}^{(n)} = \sigma(\mathbf{z}^{(n)}) $$
# $$ \mathbf{z}^{(n)} = \mathbf{W}^{(n)}\mathbf{a}^{(n-1)} + \mathbf{b}^{(n)} $$
#
# In this worksheet we will use the *logistic function* as our activation function, rather than the more familiar $\tanh$.
# $$ \sigma(\mathbf{z}) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\mathbf{z})} $$
#
# There is no need to edit the following cells.
# They do not form part of the assessment.
# You may wish to study how it works though.
#
# **Run the following cells before continuing.**
